### Mobile Sensing, Mental Health and Individual Differences
One component of my research utilizes continuous mobile sensing to better understand factors related to mental health and personality.  This work is done in conjunction with Dr. Andrew Campbell's <a href="http://dartnets.cs.dartmouth.edu/"><b>research group</b></a> who created the <a href="http://studentlife.cs.dartmouth.edu/"><b>StudentLife App</b></a>.  Together, our research groups have examined continuous sensing factors related to <a href="http://studentlife.cs.dartmouth.edu/a43-Wang.pdf"><b>depression</b></a>, <a href="http://preprints.jmir.org/preprint/12084"><b>stress</b></a>, and conducted pilot work linking <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/03/05/276568.full.pdf"><b>passive sensing features to brain imaging data</b></a>.

### Self and Social Processing
The second line of my research examines factors related to self and social processing and seeks to answer questions such as the following: Why does negative information seem to stick in our memory? And why does it seem to stick more with certain types of people? All of us have multiple social roles that we find ourseleves in (e.g., friend, sibling, co-worker).  How do we keep a coherent sense of identity across these roles?  Or, perhaps it is better to act as a social chameleon and fragment ourselves across these roles?
