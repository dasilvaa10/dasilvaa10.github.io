I'm a graduate student in department of <a href="https://pbs.dartmouth.edu//"><b>Psychological and Brain Sciences</b></a> at Dartmouth College working with Dr. Meghan Meyer in the <a href="http://www.dartmouth-socialneurolab.com/"><b>Dartmouth Social Neuroscience Lab</b></a>. In my research, I use data collected passively through smartphones to better understand aspects of mental health and personality.

Before Dartmouth, I graduated from Iowa State University with a major in psychology and a minor in statistics.
